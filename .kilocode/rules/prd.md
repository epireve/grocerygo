**Product Requirements Document: GroceryGo - Online Grocery Shopping System**

**1. Introduction**

GroceryGo is envisioned as a modern, web-based application aimed at simplifying the grocery shopping process. It will provide customers with an online platform to browse a variety of grocery products, add them to a virtual cart, and complete purchases for delivery or pickup. The system will also include an administrative interface for managing products, inventory, orders, and users. Built using Django, styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui components, and backed by an SQLite database, GroceryGo aims to offer a convenient, efficient, and reliable alternative to traditional in-store grocery shopping.

*   **Version Control:** Git (Assumed)

**7. UI/UX Design**

*   The UI will prioritize clarity, simplicity, and ease of use.

*   Navigation will be logical, allowing users to easily find products, manage their cart, and access account information.
*   Responsive design techniques will ensure adaptability across devices.

**8. Data Model (Conceptual)**

The system will require database models to represent key entities, likely including:

*   Users (extending Django's base User model or custom)
*   User Profiles (optional, for additional user data)
*   Products (name, description, price, image URL, stock quantity)
*   Categories (name, description)
*   Cart & Cart Items (linking users, products, quantities - potentially session-based for guests)
*   Orders (linking user, status, total amount, shipping address, timestamp)
*   Order Items (linking orders, products, quantity, price at time of order)
*   Addresses (potentially reusable for users)
*   (Other supporting models as needed)

Implementation will utilize Django's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM).

**9. Out of Scope / Future Considerations**

*   Real payment gateway integration
*   Advanced promotional features (complex coupons, loyalty points)
*   Product reviews and ratings
*   Wishlist functionality
*   Real-time inventory locking during checkout
*   Delivery time slot selection or scheduling
*   Complex administrative reporting and analytics
*   Multi-language or multi-currency support
*   Third-party integrations (e.g., shipping providers)
*   Mobile applications (iOS/Android)

**10. Success Metrics**

*   Successful implementation of all listed functional requirements.
*   Ability for a user to complete the core shopping flow: Browse -> Add to Cart -> Login/Register -> Checkout -> Place Order -> View Order in History.
*   Ability for an administrator to perform core management tasks: Login -> Manage Products -> View Orders -> Update Order Status.
*   Positive usability feedback from any user testing conducted.
*   Application functions correctly and responsively across specified browsers and device types.
*   Absence of critical security vulnerabilities identified during testing.
