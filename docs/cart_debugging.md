# Cart View Debugging

## Issue

A `RuntimeError` was occurring in the cart view endpoint (`/cart/view/`) with the error message "dictionary changed size during iteration". This happened in the `view_cart` function in `cart/views.py` when the code attempted to iterate through the cart dictionary while simultaneously modifying it by removing items that no longer exist in the database.

## Root Cause

In the `view_cart` function, there was a loop that iterated through the session cart items:

```python
for product_slug, quantity in cart.items():
    # Code that potentially removes items from the cart if they don't exist
    # This modification of the cart dict during iteration causes the RuntimeError
```

The problem occurs when Python dictionaries cannot be modified during iteration. If a product was removed from the database but still existed in a user's cart, the code attempted to delete that product from the cart dictionary while still iterating through it, which raises the RuntimeError.

## Solution

The solution was to create a copy of the cart dictionary before iterating through it:

```python
# Create a copy of the cart to avoid modification during iteration
cart_copy = cart.copy()

for product_slug, quantity in cart_copy.items():
    # Now we can safely modify the original cart dictionary
    # without affecting the iteration
```

Additionally, we added a safety check before removing items:

```python
if product_slug in cart:
    del cart[product_slug]
    request.session["cart"] = cart
```

This ensures we only attempt to delete keys that exist in the original cart.

## Testing

The solution was tested by:

1. Adding products to the cart
2. Accessing the cart view
3. Verifying that products can be removed from the cart
4. Ensuring the cart displays correctly even when products no longer exist in the database

This fix ensures a more robust shopping experience for users, preventing errors when viewing their cart.
